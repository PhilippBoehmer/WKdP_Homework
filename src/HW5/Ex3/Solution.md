## Exception Handling in `Calculator::divide`

### a) Handling the Exception in Two Variants

#### Variant 1: Handle the Exception Within `Calculator::divide`

In this approach, the `divide` method itself handles the exception and returns a default value (e.g., `Double.NaN`):

```java
package HW5.Ex3;

public class Calculator {
    public static double divide(double a, double b) {
        try {
            return a / b;
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.err.println("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.");
            return Double.NaN; // Return a default value
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Calculator.divide(3, 0)); // Outputs: NaN
    }
}
```

#### Variant 2: Delegate Exception Handling to the Caller

In this approach, the `divide` method does not handle the exception but instead propagates it to the caller. The caller (in this case, `main`) handles the exception:

```java
package HW5.Ex3;

public class Calculator {
    public static double divide(double a, double b) {
        return a / b; // Let the exception propagate
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println(Calculator.divide(3, 0));
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.err.println("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.");
        }
    }
}
```

### b) Which Variant Makes More Sense?

**Variant 2 (Delegate exception handling to the caller)** makes more sense in this case. Here's why:

- **Flexibility**: Delegating exception handling allows the caller to decide how to handle the exception, making the method more reusable in different contexts.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The `divide` method focuses solely on performing the division, while the caller handles the error reporting or recovery logic.
- **Consistency**: If the method is part of a library, propagating exceptions is a common practice, as it allows the library user to handle errors in their own way.

---

### c) Example Where Variant 1 Makes More Sense

**Variant 1 (handling the exception within the method)** makes more sense in cases where:

- The method is self-contained and does not rely on external error-handling logic.
- A default behavior (e.g., returning a fallback value) is sufficient to handle the error.

**Example**: A method that calculates the average of an array of numbers but handles division by zero internally.

```java
public class MathUtils {
    public static double calculateAverage(int[] numbers) {
        if (numbers == null || numbers.length == 0) {
            System.err.println("Error: Cannot calculate average of an empty array.");
            return 0.0; // Default value
        }
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : numbers) {
            sum += num;
        }
        return sum / (double) numbers.length;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(calculateAverage(new int[]{})); // Outputs: 0.0
    }
}
```
